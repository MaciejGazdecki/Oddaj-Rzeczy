This project I coded from XD grid, whicg was given to me. It is not responsive. Only desktop version was asked.

I used the following stack

1. React,
2. React-router,
3. React hooks, (I downloaded as well custom hooks like useForm)
4. ESLint,
5. Babel,
6. axios,
7. css/sass modules,
8. file-loader,
9. firebase
    
I used WebPack to bundle the files, I prepared the template of WebPack few months ago. On this webPage you can donate,
things which you do not need to non-profit foundation. It is of course a template webPage and it is not working.
You can register and log in to pass to donation form. Of course is a fake page, it is only layout, anyway records from
forms are stored in real database in json format (firebase). I will probably continue with this project.
